pythonChess2
------------
This is my second attempt at a chess program in python
The first time around did not work 100% correctly and was text based
I am hoping to improve these aspects this time around

Incremental-Program (to do list):

1. create a game pop up using Pygame
2. create the board using Pygame
3. create pieces in Pygame
4. define a simple piece (rook)
5. test simple piece
6. add steps or beautify code/game appearance
